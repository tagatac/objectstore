objput reads the contents of the object from stdin; objget writes the
contents of a retrieved object to stdout.  objlist lists all of the objects
belonging to the specified user; if the -l option is given (and options
can appear in any order), all metadata associated with the object is
displayed as well.

The arguments are as follows:

	objput -u username objname
	objget -u username objname
	objlist -u username [-l]
