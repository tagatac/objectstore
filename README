Setting up the Object Store
===========================
To set up the object store, run `make install` as any user with sudo permissions.
After installation, the empty object store, and all accessor binaries will be
located at /var/local/objectstore.

Comments on Usage
=================
* Commands must be run from /var/local/objectstore.
* Other users' objects are accessed with the format:
	<other username>+<objname>
* ACL's consist of one or more lines of the format:
	(<username>|*).(<groupname>|*)\t[r][w][x][p][v]\n

Assumptions
===========
* Anyone with access to the objtestacl command is allowed to know the contents
	of all ACLs.
* The user 'tinyvm' has full access to the source code and the object store;
	access is restricted to running the binaries for other non-root users.
* Usernames 'acls' and 'metadata' are disallowed.

Overwrite Handling
==================
Overwriting is allowed based on the ACL only.  When an overwrite occurs, a new
passphrase is obtained, and a new IV is generated.
