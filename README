Setting up the Object Store
===========================
To set up the object store, run `make install` as any user with sudo permissions.
After installation, the empty object store, and all accessor binaries will be
located at /var/local/objectstore.

Object Store Owner
==================
I have chosen to make tinyvm the owner of the object store as opposed to root.
As the object store can be contained within a user area, there is no need to
risk exposing root privileges with a setuid program.

Installation Permissions
========================
Upon installation, the data directory, which contains the actual object store
data, is owned by 'tinyvm' with permissions 700.  This ensures that only tinyvm
can access its contents.  The six obj* executables are also owned by tinyvm with
permissions 711 and the set UID bit set.  This allows all users to access the
object store via these six executables.  When the executables are run, they
assume 'tinyvm's UID as their EUID.  Consequently, they are able to manipulate
the object store.  However, the lack of other permissions ensures that
non-root users other than 'tinyvm' are not able to manipulate or copy any of the
executables or the data.

Comments on Usage
=================
* Other users' objects are accessed with the format
	<UID of other user>+<objname>.
* ACL's consist of one or more lines of the format
	<UID>|*.<GID>|*\t[r][w][x][p][v]\n

Assumptions
===========
* Anyone with access to the objtestacl command is allowed to know the contents
	of all ACLs.
* The user 'tinyvm' has full access to the source code and the object store;
	access is restricted to running the binaries for other non-root users.
